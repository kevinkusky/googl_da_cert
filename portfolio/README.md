# Preventing Churn at Waze

>Collaborate with your Waze teammates to analyze and interpret data, 
>generate valuable insights, and help leadership make informed business decisions.
>Your team is about to start a new project to help prevent user churn on the Waze app. 
>Churn quantifies the number of users who have uninstalled the Waze app or 
>stopped using the app. This project focuses on monthly user churn. 
>
>This project is part of a larger effort at Waze to increase growth. 
>Typically, high retention rates indicate satisfied users who repeatedly use the Waze app over time. 
>Developing a churn prediction model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, 
>and grow Wazeâ€™s business. 
>
>An accurate model can also help identify specific factors that 
>contribute to churn and answer questions such as: 
>
>>- Who are the users most likely to churn
>>- Why do users churn
>>- When do users churn
